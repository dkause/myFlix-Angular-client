# My-Flix-Angular

Hi Nizar,

I am currently working on branch: https://github.com/dkause/myFlix-Angular-client/tree/AA-Part-2
The Angular Project, these points are difficult for me:

1. in the profile component, I need to write the code for updating the favorites and updating the user profile.
   It takes really long for me to connect with api, I need help there.

   Here is the api service called: 'myflix-service', [myFlixService](src/app/fetch-api-data.service.ts)

2. If you look at movie card: I use angular materials mat-grid-tile, as a layout. Inside is a matcard for the movie, the cover-image has strange behavior.
